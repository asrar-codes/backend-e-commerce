# **E Commerce App**

> ## High overview of the features i want to implement

## What I'm learning with this project

- Nodejs (express included)
- Nextjs
- Mongodb (mongoose) (data modelling)
- aws/azure (for file upload)
- File upload (Multer)
- Web sockets
- Payment Integration (stripe)

## _User Authentication_:

- Build authentication system to handle user authentication.
- Create separate authentication routes for buyers and sellers.
- When a user registers, store their credentials securely (hashed passwords) in your database.
- Implement logout functionality. Reset password

#### _User Roles_:

- Assign roles to users (buyer or seller) during registration or account setup.
- You can store the user role in the database (e.g., as a field in the user model).
- Buyers and sellers will have different permissions based on their roles.

#### _Seller Profile_:

- Sellers should have a profile where they can manage their products and inventory.
- Create a seller dashboard where they can:
- Add new products: Implement a form to add product details (name, description, price, image, videos, inventory count.).
- Edit existing products: Allow sellers to update product information (e.g., change inventory levels).
- View their existing products: Display a list of products associated with the seller.

## Product Management:

- Each product should be associated with a seller.
- In your database, create a relationship between sellers and products (e.g., a foreign key from the product table to the seller table).
- When a seller adds a new product, link it to their profile.

### Inventory Updates:

- When a seller updates the inventory (e.g., restocks a product), trigger a real-time update using web sockets.
- Emit an event to connected clients (buyers‚Äô browsers) to update the product details (e.g., ‚ÄúIn stock: 10 items‚Äù).
- Buyers will see the updated inventory without refreshing the page.

## **Security Considerations**:

- Ensure that sellers can only edit their own products (authorization).
- Protect sensitive routes (e.g., adding/editing products) by checking the user‚Äôs role.
- Validate input data to prevent malicious actions.

## Cloud Integration:

- For scalability and reliability, consider integrating with a cloud service (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure).
- Host your application, database, and static files (product images) in the cloud.
- Use cloud storage services for file uploads (e.g., Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage).

## **Testing and Deployment:**

- Test your authentication flow thoroughly (registration, login, role-based access).
- Deploy your application using Docker containers for consistency across environments.
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Remember to handle edge cases (e.g., what happens when a product goes out of stock) and provide clear error messages to users. Good luck üõíüåü
